# Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) in Python

For quantitative applications such as numerical simulations, it is convenient to have full control over the Pseudo-Random Number Generator we choose to use. For this reason, I implemented my own version of the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG), a simple and reliable algorithm.


## Brief Theoretical Background
An LCG is a method for generating real non-negative pseudo-random numbers from the uniform distribution on $(0, 1)$.

First, an LCG produces a sequence of non-negative integers called *states* according to the recurring relation

$$x_i = (a \cdot x_{i-1} + c) \ mod \ m \qquad with \ i = \\{0, 1, ...\\}$$

Where
* $m > 0$ is the *modulus*; mod m stands for "modulo m", which means you divide by m and take the remainder.
* $x_i = \\{0, 1, ..., m - 1\\}$ is the i-th state of the generator 
* $x_0 = \\{0, 1, ..., m - 1\\}$ is a non-negative integer constant called *seed*. The seed is the initial state of the generator
* $a = \\{0, 1, ..., m - 1\\}$ is a non-negative integer constant called *multiplier*
* $c = \\{0, 1, ..., m - 1\\}$ is a non-negative integer constant called *increment*

The integer constants m, a, c and x_0 specify the generator.

For each state generated by the LCG, we can take

$$u_i = \frac{x_i}{m}$$

Where $u_i$ is a real pseudo-random number from the uniform distribution on $(0, 1)$.



## About this Repo
This small project explores a simple implementation of the LCG as a Python generator. All the code is contained in the lcg.py file and is pretty straightforward.
